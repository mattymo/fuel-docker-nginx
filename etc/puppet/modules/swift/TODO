Disclaimer - this does not work yet.

I will make a release when I feel like things are coming together.

I am only releasing this on github, b/c people are interested in the
code dispite the fact that it does not quite work yet.

This currently only works on ubuntu releases that
can configure swift using upstart


swift is currently not using ssl for transport b/c I did not create
self signed certs as a part of the installation
(also swift proxy is not configured to use those certs)

# not

# disable TIME_WAIT.. wait..
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle=1
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1
# disable syn cookies
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 0
# double amount of allowed conntrack
net.ipv4.netfilter.ip_conntrack_max = 26214

autocreate - should be set to true if tempauth is used


verify uniqueness constaint of url/port across types
  - if it exists, they should be the same type
